# aubreyjcook-dev_sandbox

Each experiment in this repo is its own sandbox. Toolchains, dependencies, ports, and containers stay inside that project so one stack does not change another.

Run every command below from the project directory, not the repo root. Host ports are registered in `PORTS.md`.

## Structure

```
mise.toml                     Node 24, pnpm 10, and Rust stable

db/postgres/                  PostgreSQL 18, port 5432
db/mysql/                     MySQL 8.4, port 3306
db/sqlite/                    SQLite file, no host port
rust/hello/                   Cargo crate
cpp/hello/                    CMake project, optional dev container
css/plain/                    CSS files, no toolchain
css/tailwind-playground/      Tailwind 4, port 5175
asm/x86-nasm/                 Linux x86-64, NASM
asm/arm64/                    Linux AArch64, QEMU
asm/wasm-wat/                 WebAssembly text format, wabt
```

`js/`, `php/`, `db/`, `rust/`, `cpp/`, `css/`, and `asm/` are plain directories. They hold projects and nothing else: no manifest, no linter config, and no Tailwind or PostCSS config.

## Isolation

- Every project has its own manifest (`package.json`, `composer.json`, `Cargo.toml`, or `CMakeLists.txt`) and its own `.gitignore`.
- The repo root has no `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig`, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, PostCSS, or Cargo workspace. Tools that search parent directories stop before they find another project.
- Node, pnpm, and Rust come from [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). JS projects pin Node again in their own `mise.toml`. `js/angular-app` stays on Node 22. The other JS apps pin Node 24.
- Run package CLIs from the project (`pnpm exec`, `pnpm dlx`). Leave `ng`, `nest`, `next`, and Tailwind uninstalled globally.
- PHP, assembly, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite run in Docker. Each compose file sets its own project name and network. A database belongs to that compose project only. Laravel and WordPress do not use `db/postgres` or `db/mysql`. `js/graphql-api` keeps its notes in memory.
- Vite apps set `strictPort`, so a busy port fails instead of moving to the next number.

## Prerequisites

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) and Docker Desktop. On Windows, use the WSL2 backend for Docker. From the repo root:

```powershell
mise install
```

That installs Node, pnpm, and Rust on the host. PHP, Composer, NASM, QEMU, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite stay inside images. The C++ sandbox uses a host CMake and compiler, or the dev container described under `cpp/hello`.

Start Docker Desktop before any `docker compose` command.

## JavaScript and TypeScript

These projects install dependencies into their own `node_modules`. From the project directory:

```powershell
pnpm install
```

### js/next-app

Next.js on port 3000. Node 24.

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

`pnpm build` writes the production output to `.next`. `pnpm start` serves that build on port 3000.

### js/react-app

Vite and React on port 5173. Node 24.

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

`pnpm build` writes static files to `dist`. `pnpm preview` serves that folder on port 5173.

### js/angular-app

Angular on port 4200. This folder pins Node 22 in `mise.toml`. `@angular/cli` is a dev dependency of this project.

```powershell
pnpm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200`.

```powershell
pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` writes the production bundle to `dist/angular-app`.

### js/vue-app

Vite and Vue on port 5174. Node 24. React already uses Vite's default port 5173.

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174`.

```powershell
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

`pnpm build` writes static files to `dist`. `pnpm preview` serves that folder on port 5174.

### js/nest-api

Nest on port 3001. Node 24. `@nestjs/cli` is a dev dependency of this project. `GET /` returns `{ "ok": true, "service": "nest-api" }`.

```powershell
pnpm start:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`.

```powershell
pnpm exec nest build
pnpm start
```

`pnpm exec nest build` compiles TypeScript into `dist`. `pnpm start` compiles if needed and runs the API on port 3001.

### js/graphql-api

GraphQL Yoga on port 4000. Node 24 runs `src/index.ts` directly, so there is no compile step and no build artifact. The schema and the `notes` list live in this process.

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm start` is the same command. GraphiQL is at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

```graphql
query {
  notes {
    id
    body
  }
}
```

## CSS

### css/plain

Stylesheet and page only. Open `css/plain/index.html` in a browser. There is nothing to install or build.

### css/tailwind-playground

Tailwind 4 and Vite on port 5175. Tailwind is installed in this folder. Configuration is `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/styles.css`. Node 24.

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5175`.

```powershell
pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` writes static files to `dist`.

## PHP

PHP and Composer are inside the images. Build the Laravel image before the first start. WordPress uses published images, so Compose pulls them on start.

### php/laravel-app

Compose project `sandbox-laravel`, network `sandbox-laravel-net`, host port 8000. MySQL is reachable only as `db` on that network.

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The page prints the PHP version and `mysql ok` when the database is ready.

`public/index.php` is a placeholder so the stack answers before the Laravel skeleton exists. To replace it, from this directory:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm --no-deps app composer create-project laravel/laravel /tmp/laravel --prefer-dist --no-interaction
docker compose run --rm --no-deps app sh -c "cp -a /tmp/laravel/. /var/www/html/"
```

Keep this compose file. After that copy, `docker compose up --build` still starts the app. Laravel's Vite assets, including Tailwind, belong in this project.

### php/wordpress-site

Compose project `sandbox-wordpress`, network `sandbox-wordpress-net`, host port 8080. MariaDB stays on that network. WordPress core stays in the `wp-data` volume.

```powershell
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and finish the installer. There is no local build step. A theme that uses Tailwind needs its own `package.json` and build inside that theme directory.

## Databases

These three servers are independent of Laravel, WordPress, and GraphQL. Compose pulls the PostgreSQL and MySQL images. SQLite is built from this repo.

### db/postgres

PostgreSQL 18. Compose project `sandbox-postgres`, network `sandbox-postgres-net`, host port 5432.

```powershell
docker compose up
```

```text
host=localhost port=5432 dbname=sandbox user=sandbox password=sandbox
```

`init/01-schema.sql` creates the `notes` table the first time the volume is created. Later starts keep that volume. There is no application compile step.

### db/mysql

MySQL 8.4. Compose project `sandbox-mysql`, network `sandbox-mysql-net`, host port 3306. This is separate from the MySQL service inside `php/laravel-app`.

```powershell
docker compose up
```

```text
mysql://sandbox:sandbox@localhost:3306/sandbox
```

`init/01-schema.sql` creates the `notes` table the first time the volume is created. There is no application compile step.

### db/sqlite

SQLite in compose project `sandbox-sqlite`, network `sandbox-sqlite-net`. There is no host port. The `sqlite3` binary stays in the image, and `sandbox.db` stays in this directory.

```powershell
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm sqlite sandbox.db ".read schema.sql"
docker compose run --rm sqlite sandbox.db "SELECT * FROM notes;"
```

The second command prints the seeded note. This opens the shell:

```powershell
docker compose run --rm sqlite sandbox.db
```

## Rust

### rust/hello

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins stable for this folder. There is no `Cargo.toml` above this directory, so Cargo treats the crate as its own package.

```powershell
cargo run
```

That builds and runs the binary. To build without running:

```powershell
cargo build
```

The debug binary is `target/debug/hello` (`target/debug/hello.exe` on Windows).

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The release binary is `target/release/hello` (`target/release/hello.exe` on Windows).

## C++

### cpp/hello

Configure an out-of-tree build, then compile. Objects stay in `build/`.

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

With Makefiles or Ninja, run `build/hello`. With the Visual Studio generator, run `build/Debug/hello.exe`.

Open this folder in the dev container (`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/cpp:debian-12`) when you want that image's GCC instead of the host compiler. Inside the container, use the same CMake commands, then run `./build/hello`.

## Assembly

Each target has its own image, compose project, and network. `docker compose run` builds the image on first use, then `make` assembles and runs the program inside the container. The Linux binaries do not run on the Windows host.

### asm/x86-nasm

Target: Linux x86-64. Assembler: NASM, Intel syntax. Compose project `sandbox-asm-x86`, network `sandbox-asm-x86-net`.

```powershell
docker compose run --rm app make
```

`make` writes `hello` in this directory and runs it. Output is `hello from x86-64`.

### asm/arm64

Target: Linux AArch64. Assembler: GNU as, via `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`. The image runs the static binary with `qemu-aarch64`. Compose project `sandbox-asm-arm64`, network `sandbox-asm-arm64-net`.

```powershell
docker compose run --rm app make
```

Output is `hello from aarch64`.

### asm/wasm-wat

Target: WebAssembly, text format. Assembler: `wat2wasm` from wabt. Compose project `sandbox-asm-wasm`, network `sandbox-asm-wasm-net`.

```powershell
docker compose run --rm app make
```

`make` writes `hello.wasm` and prints the module with `wasm-objdump`. `hello.wat` exports `add(i32, i32) -> i32`.

## Add a project

```powershell
./scripts/new-project.ps1 js my-experiment
```

```bash
bash scripts/new-project.sh js my-experiment
```

Groups: `js`, `php`, `rust`, `cpp`, `css`, `asm`.

Work inside the new directory. If it listens on a port, change the template default and add a row to `PORTS.md`. The CSS template defaults to port 5199. The PHP template defaults to port 8090.
